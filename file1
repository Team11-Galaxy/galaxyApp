git branch --> to view branches
  $git branch $branchname --> create a new branch with the specified name, 
  but it will not switch to that branch.
  To switch to the new branch, you can use
  $git checkout $branchname
  Alternatively, you can combine the branch creation and checkout into a 
  single command using the "-b" flag
  $git checkout -b $branchname --> creates a branch and move you to it
  $git branch --> use to show the present branches 
- git branch -d $branchname --> use to delete a branch
