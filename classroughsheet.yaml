  1. create a directory with name "your firstname"
  2. create a file with name "firstname-2" within the directory on Q1
  3. Copy the file above to your default home directory
  4. Change the name of the file to any name of your choice
  5. delete the file from the above directory

    '' Devops is an automated process of building ,testing and deploying application codes
       We need to understand the software development lifecycle to become a devops engineer''

  2. check how many characters exist within your file
  3. check the number of words within the file
